DISSERTATION JOINT REPORT
Will Bolton - Cubic curves over finite fields - MATH491

Content and Understanding: A
Excellent: the student has a very good understanding of the algebraic
and geometric notions involved in the subject: ring theory (euclidean
algorithm, finite fields), projective and affine geometries, elliptic
curves as curves and as group. 
A few flaws on p. 11 (typos in projective transformations and example
intersection multiplicity), p. 20-21, 24 in the long proof of Gauss'
theorem (can be condoned!), and p. 26 Def 2.2 (C is not homogeneous and
the notions "successful", "fails" need be explained). 
Excellent choice of material and selected original examples, presented
in concise fashion which also shows a very good understanding of the key
results. 

Organisation and Style: A
Excellent: the structure of the report is very good, and so is the use
of LaTeX, Python (Lenstra's algorithm), and TikZ, Geogebra, OS X's
Grapher and even R (figures).
Very good writing style, pleasant to read, excellent grammar and
spelling. Occasional typos.
Good range of references (including an Annals of Math. and 3 Crelle's
papers!).

Initiative: A
From the start the student has worked independently, and our weekly
meetings allowed us to go together over the needed abstract algebra
which was Will's weakest point. 
From the dissertation, he has caught up with the theory, and exceeded my
expectations in implementing Lenstra's algorithm using Python and
working out his own examples.
