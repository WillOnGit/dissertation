Knowledge of projective geometry is vital to understanding elliptic curves, as they are curves that are defined in the projective plane.
However, the definition is not too complicated.
\begin{definition}
	An elliptic curve is a regular, projective cubic curve.
\end{definition}
Here, a cubic simply means that the polynomial that defines the curve is of degree three. So for example, $F(X,Y,Z) = X^3 + 2XYZ + 5YZ^2 + \frac{1}{2}Z^3$ defines an elliptic curve $F(X,Y,Z) = 0$. % Check this!!
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{definition}
	An elliptic curve is a non-singular cubic projective curve. For our purposes, they can all be written as $y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x)$ is a cubic polynomial in $x$ with no repeated roots.
\end{definition}
