\begin{definition}
	A field is a commutative, unital ring in which every non-zero element is invertible
\end{definition}
The group $Z_n$ is a field if and only if $n$ is prime.
\begin{definition}
	The projective plane is an extension of regular 2-dimensional euclidean space by adding ``points at infinity'' such that every pair of lines intersects exactly once.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
	An elliptic curve is a non-singular cubic projective curve. For our purposes, they can all be written as $y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x)$ is a cubic polynomial in $x$ with no repeated roots.
\end{definition}
For elliptic curves over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$, when adding points $(x_1,y_1) + (x_2,y_2) = (x',y')$,
$$x'=\lambda^2 - a - x_1 - x_2,\quad y' = \lambda x_1 -\lambda x' - y_1 $$
where $\lambda = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$ if $x_1\neq x_2$ or $\lambda=\frac{3x_1^2 + 2ax_1 + b}{2y_1}$ otherwise.
