% 	Make initial argument about Mp
% 	Manipulate [RRR]

\begin{theorem}
Define $M_p$ to be the number of projective solutions to the equation $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0$ in the field $\fp$. Then,
\begin{itemize}
\item if $p \not\equiv 1 \mod{3}$, then $M_p = p + 1$.
\item otherwise $p \equiv 1 \mod{3}$, and there exist integers $A$ and $B$ such that
	$$4p = A^2 + 27B^2$$
	Since $A^2 \equiv 1 \mod{3}$, $A \equiv \pm1 \mod{3}$. If we fix the sign of A so that $A \equiv 1 \mod{3}$, then
	$$M_p = p + 1 + A$$
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof of the two separate cases both rely on the same idea, but in the second case requires many more steps before the result is reached, and beginning the proof without an idea of what is to come can make it very hard to understand, as numerous objects are introduced. Therefore we will prove the first case, provide an outline of the proof second case and then finally supply the details.

For both cases, the proof revolves around examining the homomorphism
$$\varphi: \fpu \rightarrow \fpu \qquad x \mapsto x^3$$
Now in the first case, since 3 does not divide the order of $\fpu$, $\varphi$ is bijective, and so an isomorphism. This means that each element of $\fp$ has exactly one cube root. For example, in $\fp[11]$, we have:
\begin{align*}
	0^3 &= 0,\quad
	1^3 = 1,\quad
	7^3 = 2,\quad
	9^3 = 3,\quad
	5^3 = 4,\quad
	3^3 = 5,\\
	8^3 &= 6,\quad
	6^3 = 7,\quad
	2^3 = 8,\quad
	4^3 = 9,\quad
	10^3 = 10.
\end{align*}
This implies that every solution of $x + y + z = 0$ gives exactly one solution of $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0$ by cube rooting each of $x,y,z$. Since $x + y + z = 0$ is the equation of a line in the projective plane, it has exactly $p+1$ solutions. This settles the first case.
\end{proof}
