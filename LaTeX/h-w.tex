\begin{theorem}
For an elliptic curve $C$ over a finite field $\fp$, the number of points on $C = \#C(\fp) = p + 1 + \epsilon$, where $|\epsilon| \leq 2\sqrt{p}$
\end{theorem}
	This is the statement of Hasse's original result, as it pertains to elliptic curves.
	The generalisation comes from introducing the genus $g$ and allowing $C$ to be any curve, so that the theorem reads

	The proof of this theorem is very technical, and so will be omitted.

We can test the Hasse-Weil estimate by calculating the number of points on an elliptic curve $C$ over a particular finite field $\fp$. For ease of calculation, we will take $\fp = \fp[7]$ and let $C : y^2 = x^3 + x + 1$. First, we write out the squares in $\fp[7]$:
\begin{align*}
0^2 = 0\\
1^2 = 1\\
2^2 = 4\\
3^2 = 2\\
4^2 = 2\\
5^2 = 4\\
6^2 = 1
\end{align*}
Then we write out $x^3+x+1$ and match to the relevant squares.
\begin{align*}
0^3 + 0 + 1 = 1\\
1^3 + 1 + 1 = 3\\
2^3 + 2 + 1 = 4\\
3^3 + 3 + 1 = 3\\
4^3 + 4 + 1 = 6\\
5^3 + 5 + 1 = 5\\
6^3 + 6 + 1 = 6
\end{align*}
Which leads us to the four points
\begin{align*}
(0,1)\\
(0,6)\\
(2,2)\\
(2,5)
\end{align*}
Including the point at infinity $\pai$, the Hasse-Weil theorem gives $\#C(\fp[7]) = 7 + 1 + \epsilon$, where $|\epsilon| \leq 2\sqrt{7}$, which bounds the number of points on $C$ as $8\pm5$, or $\#C(\fp[7]) \in \{3,4,\ldots,13\}$. Clearly, 5 % or 4 if you don't count big O?
agrees with this estimate.
